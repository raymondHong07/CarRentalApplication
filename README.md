# RH Rentals
This is a car rental concept application catered to users who are looking to experience what renting a car in the 21st century feels like. The application is for those who not only want to get from point A to point B, but actually have a preference of what they want to get there in.

This application utilizes a personally created Firebase to manipulate data that was set up for the purpose of demonstration, as well as handle authentication. The format of the data is stored in a JSON format that can be found in this repo to showcase the structure of the data being pulled from Firebase.

TO DO:
 - code clean up
 - better organize code within managers
 - Look into converting Car data model to a codeable/decodeable struct
