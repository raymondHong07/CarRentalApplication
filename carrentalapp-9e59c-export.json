    "What are the checkout limits?": "These limits are in place to make sure everyone has a good time driving one of our vehicles and uses them responsibly. Therefore, (1) Each member is entitled to only one 1 vehicle until returned and (2) Each member is entitled to rent multiple vehicles so long as the requested dates do not overlap.",
    "What are the payment methods available?": "At the moment, we only accept Credit/Debit card payments.",
    "Why is there a checkout limit?": "Rover rents vehicles to a single individual who is responsible for the well being of the vehicle. Renting multiple vehicles suggests that the renter will not be driving the other vehicle(s) and therefore it is recommended intended drivers create an account with us to rent a vehicle.",
    "Why must I make a payment immediately at checkout?": "Rover is on ‘first-come-first-served’ basis. To ensure that you get your desired vehicle, it is recommended that you have your method of payment ready for payment after choosing your vehicle."
